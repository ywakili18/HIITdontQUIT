    >On Odd Days
Do 200 push-ups in as few sets as possible in addition to your regularly scheduled workout of cardio exercises. You still can do upper-body workouts on these days if you are already on a program. This is a supplemental 200 push-ups using maximum repetition sets (4 x 50, 8 x 25 ... it's your choice how you get to 200).

On Even Days
Do 200 push-ups throughout the day. This can be little sets of 10 done every half-hour or 50 push-ups done four times throughout the day. </b-carousel-slide>
